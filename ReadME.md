- ### Machine Learning

     - [Supervised Learning: Predict Customer Buying Behavior](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/British-Airways-Virtual-Experience-Program/blob/main/Predicting%20Customer%20Buying%20Behavior.ipynb): This was the second Task of British Airways Virtual Experience program. Using the provided data we had to predict wether a cutomer would complete a booking.
     
         _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, imbalanced-learn, seaborn, matplotlib_

    - [Supervised Learning: Medical Cost Analysis](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Global-AI-Hub-International-ML-Bootcamp/blob/master/Medical%20Cost%20Analysis.ipynb): This was the final project for the Global AI Hub International ML Bootcamp.the The aim of the project is to estimate the approximate cost of a person's health insurance.
    
         _Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib_

    - [Supervised Learning: Predict Career Longevity for NBA Rookies](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Global-AI-Hub-International-ML-Bootcamp/blob/master/Predict%20Career%20Longevity%20for%20NBA%20Rookies.ipynb): This was a competition that was part of the Python for Machine Learning International Bootcamp by Global AI Hub. The aim is to predict career longevity of NBA rookies.
    
         _Tools: scikit-learn, xgboost, Pandas, imbalanced-learn, seaborn, matplotlib_
    
    - [Supervised Learning: Parkison's Disease Detection](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Parkison-s-Disease/blob/main/Parkison's%20Disease%20Detection.ipynb): The aim of the project is to predict if a person has Parkison's Disease using biomedical voice measurements.
    
         _Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib_

    - [Supervised Learning: Predicting Type of Wine](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Wine-Type/blob/main/Predicting%20Wine%20Type.ipynb): The aim of the project is to predict if the type of wine is red or white using the famous wine quality dataset.
    
         _Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, imbalanced-learn, seaborn, matplotlib_
    
    - [Unsupervised Learning: Mall Customers Segmentation](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Mall-Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/CustomerSegmentation.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various mall customers.
    
         _Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, KMeans, seaborn, matplotlib_
         
- ### Natural Language Processing

    - [Webscrapping and Customer Reviews Analysis](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/British-Airways-Virtual-Experience-Program/blob/main/Web%20Scrapping%20Customer%20Reviews%20Analysis.ipynb): This was the first task of British Airways Virtual Experience program. Data was scrapped from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways). The data was customer reviews about british airways airline. The data was cleaned and analysed using NLP techniques such as topic modelling and semantic analysis.

        _Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, beautifulsoup, nltk, gensim, wordcloud, vader, LatentDirichletAllocation, seaborn, matplotlib_ 

- ### Data Analysis and Visualization.

    * __Power BI__
    
        - [SuperStore Dashboard](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/SuperStore-Sales-Dashboard): These are Power BI reports that analyze the superstore sales data.  
        
- ### Micro Projects: 

    - __Python__
    
        - [Kafka Producer and Consumer](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Kafka-Intro/): An introduction to Apache Kafka. Containing a producer thats sends data to a topic and a consumer that reads from th topic.
