## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
     - [SupervisedLearning: Customers Segmentation Using RFM Analysis](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/KPMG-Virtual-Program/blob/main/customer_segmentation.ipynb): In this project we perfrom customer segmentation using Recency, Frequency and Monetary analysis on current customers. After segmentation, the customers are assigned as psossible target or not. Finally we train a LGBMClassifier and use it to predict on new customers.
    
         _Tools: scikit-learn, pandas,RFM analysis, LGBMClassifier, imblearn, plotly_
         
     - [SupervisedLearning: Stock Percentage Estimation](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/Cognizant-Virtual-Program/blob/main/Task-3%20Modelling.ipynb): Estimate stock percentage.

         _Tools: scikit-learn, pandas, KMeans, seaborn, matplotlib_
         
- ### Natural Language Processing

    - [Webscrapping and Customer Reviews Analysis](https://github.com/dalphonorechi/British-Airways-Virtual-Experience-Program/blob/main/Web%20Scrapping%20Customer%20Reviews%20Analysis.ipynb): This was the first task of British Airways Virtual Experience program. Data was scrapped from [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways). The data was customer reviews about british airways airline. The data was cleaned and analysed using NLP techniques such as topic modelling and semantic analysis.
